# Chip8Interpreter
A CHIP8 interpreter written in C++.  
This interpreter is based off of Laurence Muller's tutorial for building a CHIP8 emulator.  

I created this program in sophomore year for learning purposes (getting better at C++).I also was very interested in how emulators worked and computer architecture, so this was a great project to learn from.  
As of right now, I am using the same code as Muller to display the output onto a separate window using GLUT(OpenGL), since I wasn't too interested in learning how to use the OpenGL API. The code works for displaying a game, but later revisions would be needed in order to make the interpreter more playable. Later on, I will make my own file for displaying output using Qt or GTK(haven't decided yet, currently brushing up on my C/C++ skills). I might also expand on this interpreter by integrating sound into the emulator using SDL.  

Full credit to Laurence Muller for the OpenGL code.
