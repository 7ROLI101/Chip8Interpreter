# Chip8Interpreter
A CHIP8 interpreter written in C++.  
This program was created for learning purposes (getting better at C++).  
I also was very interested in how emulators worked and computer architecture, so this was a great project to learn from.  
As of right now, the code works for displaying a game, but later revisions would be needed in order to make the interpreter more playable.
